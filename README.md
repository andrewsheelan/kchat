# kchat
WIP

My very first React on Rails!!!!

Here's a demo of what this can do so far:
----------
https://aqueous-wave-4723.herokuapp.com/


- Coffee script for creating React Components

- Tubesock for Websockets for the Polling
https://github.com/ngauthier/tubesock

- Bootstrap
http://getbootstrap.com/

- puma
http://puma.io

To run locally:
----------
 ``` unix
$ git clone https://github.com/andrewsheelan/kchat
$ bundle
$ rake db:migrate
$ puma
 ```
 go to url: http://localhost:3000

Like I said, this is a WIP, miles to go before this can be any useful.

I would be glad if this code can help someone, in someway, trying to start using this technology with Rails. Hit me up with any questions!









> *Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. -  Corinthians 13:4-8 New King James Version (NKJV)*
