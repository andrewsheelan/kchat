WIP

My first very first React on Rails!!!!

Here's a demo of what this can do so far:
https://aqueous-wave-4723.herokuapp.com/

Gems:
- Coffee script for creating React Components

- Pusher
https://dashboard.pusher.com

- Bootstrap
http://getbootstrap.com/

- puma
http://puma.io

Like I said, this is a WIP, miles to go before this can be real useful.

I would be glad if this code can help someone, in someway, trying to start using this technology with Rails. Hit me up with any questions!
