WIP
My first rails & reactjs.


Here's a demo of what this can do so far:
https://aqueous-wave-4723.herokuapp.com/

Gems:
react-rails
-- may use rails assets


- Coffee script for creating React Components (ES6 classes)

- Server Sent Events or Tubesock for Websockets for the Polling

- Bootstrap

- puma or passenger / sqlite3

Like I said, this is a WIP, miles to go before this can be real useful.
